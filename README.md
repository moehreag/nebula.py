# Nebulae
An alternative for [Nebula](https://github.com/dscalzi/Nebula) which supports files and usage of Fabric Mods.
This python script makes it much easier to add mods to an Distribution Index in the HeliosLauncher format.
I used and use it to add more mods to [AxolotlClient](https://github.com/moehreag/AxolotlClient)

# Usage

- open a Command Line
- navigate to the Directory 'nebulae.py' is in
- run 'python nebulae.py'
- copy your string into the distribution.json file
- Have Fun!
